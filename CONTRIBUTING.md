#Contributing

## How can I contribute?

We love contributions!
We would like to extend this collection further to contain all kinds of resources related to all programming languages, frameworks, general programming knowledge, and IT careers.

Your contributions are more than welcome. If you have anything you liked and found useful, please share it with us:

## What to contribute?

You can check out the existing resources and see if you have anything that fits into any of the categories.
Make sure to also have a look at the [Content Guidelines](#content-guidelines) to learn more about what types of content we like and what information should be provided.

If you are motivated to help out, but are not sure where to start or what to do, you can also check out the open [Issues](https://github.com/WomenWhoCode/Berlin/issues). These are a collection of tasks that we (or others) think should be done in order to improve this repository. Maybe there is something open that would be perfect for you?
If you do start working on an issue, it is recommended to comment on the issue to let others know about your work. This can help avoid duplicate work :)


## Content Guidelines

We are happy about any contributions: tutorials, guides, (free) (e)books, video courses, online exercises, ...
Take a look and see if your resource fits any of the existing categories and/or sub-categories.
If you think the appropriate category is missing, add it.

If you are not sure where your resource belongs, you can also [create an issue](https://github.com/WomenWhoCode/Berlin/issues/new) to ask about it. Or ask in the our [slack channel](http://bit.ly/WWCHackEveningsSlack).

Ideally you will not only add a link, but also a little bit of information:
- What is it exactly? Try to describe it in a sentence or two.
- Why do you like it / or think it is useful?
- A link to the resource (Learn about how to create a clickable link in this [markdown guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax#links))
